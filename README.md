# My React Project Inspired by Ochi.design

This project is a modern and visually appealing website inspired by the design aesthetics of [Ochi.design](https://www.ochi.design/). It was created to practice and demonstrate important React concepts, including the use of advanced animation libraries like Framer Motion and Locomotive Scroll, alongside custom JavaScript animations. The project is built using React with the Vite build tool, providing a fast and optimized development experience.

## Features

- **Modern Design**: Inspired by Ochi.design, this project features a clean and responsive design that adapts well to various screen sizes.
- **Framer Motion**: Utilized for smooth and dynamic animations, adding life to the user interface.
- **Locomotive Scroll**: Implemented for parallax scrolling and other advanced scroll-based animations.
- **Custom JS Animations**: Additional animations created using vanilla JavaScript for a unique touch.
- **React with Vite**: The project is set up using Vite, offering a faster development experience compared to traditional React setups.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast and optimized build tool for modern web projects.
- **Framer Motion**: A popular animation library for React.
- **Locomotive Scroll**: A smooth scrolling library with parallax effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Used for custom animations and logic.
